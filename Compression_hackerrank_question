Compression

We use different compression techniques in order to reduce the size of the messages sent over the web. 
An algorithm designed to compress a given string by describing the total number of consecutive occurrences of each character next to it. 
For example conside the following string "alaasass", we can group the consecutive occurences of each character:

* "a" occurs one time.
* "l" occurs one time.
* "a" occurs two times consecutively.
* "s" occurs one time.
* "a" occurs one time.
* "s" occurs two times consecutively.

If a character occurs only once, it is added to the compressed string. If it occurs consecutive times, the character is added to the string followed
by an integer representing the number of consecutive occurrences .Thus the compressed form of the string is "ala2sas2".
